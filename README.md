markdown# Computational Neuroscience Projects

A collection of computational neuroscience implementations built as part of my self-directed research journey.

## Projects

### 1. Hodgkin-Huxley Neuron Model
Implementation of the classic 1952 Hodgkin-Huxley model simulating action potential generation in a single neuron.

**Key findings:**
- Identified rheobase at ~6-7 μA/cm² input current
- Demonstrated rate coding — higher input increases firing frequency not amplitude
- Sodium channel block eliminates spiking (basis of anesthetics)
- Potassium channel block causes permanent depolarization

**Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib

## Goals
Building toward computational neuroscience research in BCI and neural modeling.
